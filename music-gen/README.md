# Use
**To play the .mid file raw, e.g., on VLC player, you need .sf2 sound font and set it up for your choice of audio app**
1. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir`
2. Generate the stuff `python scales-gen.py`
3. Load the output xml in MuseScore or listen to the beautiful sound of raw midi 🤪

# Plan
- +Chords gen, +voicing gen
- MuseScore direct conversion to sheet 
- Mix with FoxDot: route midi -> LMMS / render midi -> soundfonts
- Or just go straight to DAW
